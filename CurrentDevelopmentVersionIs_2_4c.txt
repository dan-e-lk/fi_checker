When copying these files over to the deliverable folder, 

1. make sure to change the version numbers in the ArcToolbox (name of the toolbox and by going into the item description), 
the arctool, and in the Checker_v2.py script. Change Checker_v2.py script to Checker_v2xy.py as we move on to the next version.
2. make sure the relative path works. When you copy this over to C drive, the path to the script should be C drive.
3. make sure to save the toolbox as ArcToolbox 10.1 version.
